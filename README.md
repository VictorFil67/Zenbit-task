When you open the app the main page appears.
The app offers you three interactive elements for your choice.
If you use the app for the first time you need to sign up.
If you specified your credentials correctly the app moves you to the login form. Now you have to log in.
If your login is successful you move to the main page and content will appear.
Also in the login form you can access the system if you forgot your password.
Furthermore, if you don't have credentials you can move from the login form to the register form.
